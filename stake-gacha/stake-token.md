* By staking designated tokens individually, such as ETH/USDT, you can generate PEFI, and at the same time connect to the strategy of the machine gun pool. After staking the tokens into the mining pool, you can continuously generate PEFI. The accumulated PEFI is as shown in the example. Card packs can be collected when there are 5 or more.
* When the accumulated income is less than the value of cards to be withdrawn, users can pay PEFIin their wallets to make up the difference.
* Users can add or redeem staked tokens at any time
* The quality of the cards obtained is determined by the amount of income from consuming PEFI tokens. For example: Red V 80, V Star 80, IV Star 40, III Star 20, II Star 10, I Star 5 (for reference, the actual value will be subject to the actual online date).
