* Earning PEFI and Card Packs. To earn a continuous stream of PEFI tokens, provide liquidity for a specified trading pair on UniswapV2 to receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens. Then, stake these LP tokens in the mining pool. Once the accumulated PEFI earnings reach 5 or more (as shown in the example), you can claim a card pack.
* When the accumulated income is less than the value of cards to be withdrawn, users can spend PEFI in their wallets to make up the difference.
* Users can add or redeem LP tokens at any time.
* The quality of the cards obtained is determined by the amount of income from consuming PEFI tokens. For example: Red V 80, V Star 80, IV Star 40, III Star 20, II Star 10, I Star 5 (for reference, the actual value will be subject to the actual online date).
