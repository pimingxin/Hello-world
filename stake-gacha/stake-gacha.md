Tip: authorization is required before staking. Both staking and authorization are on-chain operations. It will consume a certain amount of ETH as the GAS fee.

* The card quality from high to low is: Red V 、 V Star 、IV Star 、III Star 、II Star、I Star
* By staking a corresponding amount of PEFI individually, you can obtain an NFT card of that quality with a minimum guarantee, and there is also a certain chance of obtaining a higher-quality card. For example (the actual value will be subject to the actual launch): stake 80 PEFI, you will get V Star quality NFT cards, and there is a certain chance to get Red V quality.
* Adjust the number of cards staked to get a corresponding number of card packs. Each card pack contains only 1 random card. The quality is based on the rate achieved by a PEFI quantity that is staked.&#x20;
