# Card Book Mining

After logging into the game, users will receive a card book containing a card slot. Users will need to place the NFT card in the card book to activate the power of the NFT card. The more cards users activate, the higher the total power would be; thus, the mining progress would be more efficient.

Tip: Card collection is an on-chain process, which requires a certain amount of ETH as the gas fee.

Mining income and card book total power.

* The income of card mining would be depending on the proportion of the total power of the card book in the power of the whole server. The higher the ratio, the more rewards players would receive.
* Card book total power = ∑(NFT Power \* (1 + Card Slot Level Bonus)) \* (1 + Cards Amount Bonus)
* Each one of the corresponding NFT cards can be placed in each card slot. The quality of the card determines the power of the activated card slot.
* The card slot of the corresponding card can be used to upgrade. The upgraded card slot will have a growth of power. However, the card used to upgrade will be destroyed, and the PEFI of the card will be released gradually within 120 hours. And the released PEFI can be obtained in the card mining interface;
